     * IMPORTANT NOTES:
     *  we must make sure that we always send price including taxes to the blackbox,
     *  the POS should compute prices including taxes, no matter the configuration of the taxes (price included or not).
     *
     * In a tax included / excluded context, we should ensure these properties:
     * - For each transactionLine:
     *     - transactionLine.lineTotal == Sum(vat.price + Sum(priceChange.amount)) over all VAT objects of the product.
     * - For the whole transaction:
     *    - transactionTotal == Sum(transactionLine.lineTotal)
     *
     *  Otherwise the blackbox will reject the transaction, and we won't be able to sign the order.
     *  And the idea is that these properties should still be true with every type of price changes (line discount, global discount, manual price change, loyalty,... etc.).

    /**
     * Compute a Blackbox-compatible line total.
     *
     * Context:
     * Odoo applies global rounding (`round_globally`) when computing taxes. This can
     * lead to systematic discrepancies between:
     *
     *   - The globally rounded total including taxes
     *   - The line total computed as (quantity × unit price including taxes)
     *
     * Example: (see first test inside 'input_generator.test.js')
     * Create an order line with sale price 3.34 (including 12% tax) and quantity 7.
     *   - 7 × 3.34 (price incl. 12% tax) = 23.38 (globally rounded total) => order total which is correct
     *   - Line computation: 7 × 3.34 = 23.39 => line total (displayed in the UI) which is incorrect because it miss 'delta_total_included_currency'
     *
     * This rounding mismatch exists throughout Odoo (sale, invoice, POS, etc.).
     * However, in POS it becomes critical because the fiscal blackbox requires
     * *exact* numerical consistency. Any mismatch causes the transaction to be
     * rejected and prevents signing the sale.
     *
     * Blackbox error example:
     *   "Value error, lineTotal mismatch for SINGLE_PRODUCT
     *    (expected 23.38, got 23.39)"
     *
     * This effectively yields the equivalent of:
     *   total_included_currency + delta_total_included_currency
     *
     * Notes:
     * - Combo lines still use `displayPrice`, maybe we will have same issue with combo later?
